## Bank Marketing Dataset: Predicting customer response  

## Sony Jufri

In this project, I worked with the bank customer dataset and used four supervised machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier) to predict customer response to a marketing campaign. Here, I had the opportunity to work with an imbalanced dataset (with many missing values and outliers) and used several data visualization and manipulation techniques (data cleansing and up-sampling) to address those issues. Statistical tests were then used to compare the four algorithms and assess if the proposed model significantly differs to the alternatives.
